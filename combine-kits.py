# Purpose:
# Combine raw data files from multiple autosomal tests into one file.  The
# combined file may have better coverage than the individual files.  Currently
# handles AncestryDNA, 23andMe and FTDNA, MyHeritage, and LivingDNA.
# It may support others not yet tested.  The resulting file can be uploaded
# to gedmatch.

# Instructions:
# Edit the file names below, then run this script in python2 or python3.

# Edit the data files to be combined.
# There should be at least two files listed.
# It doesn't matter if the files are extracted or compressed.
# In the examples given below, lines starting with '#' are ignored,
# and these examples are for files residing in a folder called 'test-data'.
# All data files must be based on build 37.
